# Live Market Data

This simple Python script continuously pulls the live market price of an equity from the exchange and adds it to a <code>.csv</code> file. While the way this script is currently set up is to merely add data to a file, this method has numerous applications: the script could easily be augmented to construct an automated trading bot, easily used in conjunction with my [pairs trading strategy](https://github.com/ldwhite/PairsTrading).
